# acl-anthology-browser
Code for extracting information (year, month, source - journal or conference/workshop, title, authors, country, publisher) using a keyword-based filter from the ACL Anthology dataset. This dataset needs to be downloaded before running the code. You can download the data from:
https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/tree/master/data/xml

The paths can be modified in the browse.py file. The output is stored in a tab-delimited file named out.tsv.
